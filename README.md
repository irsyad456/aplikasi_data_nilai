# About

This is a 'simple' website about schools grades.

This Website Includes Of : CRUD students, CRUD grades, CRUD subjects, and so on.

# Installation
## Using Xampp & PHP
1. Download the project
2. Put The project on xampp\htdocs
3. run the xampp (obviously)
4. Create New Database Called nilai_siswa / Change the dbname on `common\config\main-local.php` at line 7
5. open command line in project root
6. run ```bash php init ```
7. choose [0]development
8. migrate the database by running this command ```bash php yii migrate``` then choose yes
9. to serve the app run this command ```bash php yii serve --docroot="@frontend/web"
10. by default, the server will be running on [localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080)
11. (optional) you can serve the app into backend by changing the docroot into @backend/web, but it's empty for now so it's unnecessary :v
12. ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© Happy Coding :) ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©

## Without Xampp & PHP
Coming Soon :)
